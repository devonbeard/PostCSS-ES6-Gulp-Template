This template includes PostCSS & ES2015 (ES6) compliation


# PostCSS

Replace preprocessors with postCSS. PostCSS lets us take advantage of plugins that we can use to enable future css syntax and start using it today.



# Gulp Production

Run `gulp production` to minify your assets. Your assets will minify only after the test suite has passed. These assets will be saved to `dist/min`.
